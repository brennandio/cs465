-Architecture

I used two types of frontend: simple pages made with Express and a more interactive single-page application using JavaScript. For the database, I used MongoDB because it lets me store data in a flexible way without strict rules.

-Functionality

JSON is like a language that both frontend and backend understand, so they can share data easily. I improved my code by making some parts reusable, which saved time and kept the design consistent.

-Testing

I tested the website by sending requests to different URLs (endpoints) and checking if they worked. I also added login security, which required extra testing to make sure only authorized users could access certain features.

-Reflection

This course taught me how to build complete websites and solve real problems. I learned valuable skills that will help me get a job in web development in the future.
